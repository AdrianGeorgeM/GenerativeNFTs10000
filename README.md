# GenerativeNFTs10000
Hey there! I'm a blockchain enthusiast.
 I'm passionate about creating software that is both useful and fun to use. I'm also a big fan of generative art and I love creating unique and visually appealing art pieces using code.
 
GenerativeNFTs10000 is a repository that contains code for generating 10,000 unique and diverse Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or Artworks using the Canvas API and Node.js.
This project utilizes generative art techniques to create visually appealing and distinct NFTs by randomly combining various elements such as colors, shapes, patterns, and textures.

Before using the generation engine, please ensure that you have Node.js version 10.18.0 or higher installed. Once you have the required dependencies installed, you can use the provided code to generate thousands of unique NFTs that you can use for various purposes, such as selling on NFT marketplaces, using as digital collectibles, or just for personal enjoyment.

This project provides a great starting point for anyone interested in creating generative art using Node.js and the Canvas API. Feel free to modify and improve the code to suit your needs and create your own unique generative art pieces.
